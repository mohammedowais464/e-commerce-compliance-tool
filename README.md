# e---commerce-compliance-tool
We propose an automated compliance-screening tool for e-commerce product listings. Given a product link, it extracts key details and checks them against essential consumer-protection rules using a rule-based engine. The system flags missing disclosures, assigns a risk score, and provides a clear, extensible compliance report.
